# TN-Twitter
Tankie News Twitter bot for getting data on followers and the accounts we follow to analyze user engagement, help identify users to follow that are likely to have higher than average engagement rates, and unfollows users that don't follow back and have low engagement rates. 

Modified to disable unfollow function so that contributors don't unfollow random users when testing.
